    <p>There are lots of ways you can help if you are interested in seeing the web grow and be even more useful...</p>
    <h2>Put up some data</h2>
    <p>There are many ways of doing this. The web needs both raw data -- fresh hypertext or old plain text files, or smart servers giving views of existing databases. See more details, etiquette. </p>
    <h2>Suggest someone else does</h2>
    <p>Maybe you know a system which it would be neat to have on the web. How about suggesting to the person involved that they put up a W3 server?</p>
    <h2>Manage a subject area</h2>
    <p>If you know something of what's going on in a particular field, organization or country, would you like to keep up-to-date an overview of online data?</p>
    <h2>Write some software</h2>
    <p>We have a big list of things to be done. Help yourself -- all contributions gatefully received! see the <a href="">list</a>.</p>
    <h2>Send us suggestions</h2>
    <p>We love to get mail... www-bug@info.cern.ch">www-bug@info.cern.ch</p>
    <h2>Tell your friends</h2>
    <p>Install/get installed the client software on your site. Quote things by their W3 address to allow w3 users to pick them straight up.</p>
